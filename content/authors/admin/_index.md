I´m a student of the carrer in Industrial Production Engineer of the Costa Rica Institute of Technology, I´m very interest in topics that involve data science.

I recently participated in a group called [DABIA](https://www.grupodabia.com/) which is a community of interest in the data science. I would like to share opinions about all those topics in posts in the webpage of DABIA. If you want to read posts that I have made about data science and other topics or the teamwork that I have participated in the group, please visit the webpage [DABIA](https://www.grupodabia.com/).
